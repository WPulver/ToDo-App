This is a simple To-Do app I created using React, Firebase, and Material UI

Some of the code is modeled after tutorials (https://www.bennettdocs.com/react-login-with-google-firebase/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqgTr-nd7Cg&ab_channel=CleverProgrammer)

I will try my best to mark areas where I borrowed code from those tutorials with comments.
